# C Linked List Implementation

Welcome to the C Linked List Implementation repository! This project provides a simple implementation of a singly linked list in the C programming language. Linked lists are fundamental data structures in computer science, and this implementation serves as an educational resource and can be used as a foundation for more complex projects.

## Features:

- **Singly Linked List:** Implementation of a singly linked list with basic operations.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Efficient use of memory through dynamic allocation.
- **Modular Design:** Code is organized into modular functions for easy understanding and modification.
- **Usage Examples:** Code includes examples demonstrating how to use the linked list functions.
